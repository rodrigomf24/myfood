In order to start the app run gulp, this will start a server
on localhost:8080. Open on your browser http://localhost:8080/#/
I make us of webpack, webpack-dev-server and gulp to  reload the
bundle task on any js file changes, executes a development server.

For production make use of the bundled files in the dist folder.

Install any dependency through npm or feel free to use any other tool 
like bower or jspm.
